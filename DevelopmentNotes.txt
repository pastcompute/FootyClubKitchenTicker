Whilst attempting to get it to work on Debian x86_64 I tweaked up the xloader shell script to be a bit more robust.

I needed to also do:

# needed for screenly:

apt-get install python-requests python-netifaces uzbl socat feh
# apt-get remove python-bottle python-mako

# needed to get pythin package 'sh' for screenly
# virtualenv also isolates different python working environments

apt-get install python-pip python-virtualenv

cd directory/above/screenly
mkdir mypy
virtualenv mypy
pip install -E mypy sh
pip install -E mypy hurry.filesize
pip install -E mypy uptime
pip install -E mypy bottle-haml
pip install -E mypy --upgrade bottle
pip install -E mypy --upgrade mako

# then to continue testing
source mypy/bin/activate
cd screenly-ose

mkdir ~/.screenly
cp misc/screenly.conf ~/.screenly
sed -e "s@debug_logging = False@debug_logging = True@" -i ~/.screenly/screenly.conf
  
STARTUP_DELAY=1 misc/xloader.sh

Further, need to setup a web server to serve the splach screen, etc.
This will get served locally by running server.py in another terminal.


The splash page is at http://<listen>:<port>/splash_page where
listen:port is the value of the setting 'listen' in screenly.conf
By default this gets set to 0.0.0.0:8080

localhost:8080/splash_page will try and display splash screen from views/splash_page.haml

The debian squeeze installation of python-bottle 0.8.4-1 has a bug, the member variable holding
a valid list of filename extensions is spelled "extentions" but the version of bottle-haml installed from pip
uses 'extensions', so I had to manually patch __init__.py in my python vierualenv to workaround this.

Then the index page wouldnt parse properly.
So I did `apt-get remove python-bottle` and instead install newer version using pip
This fixed the typo as well *doh* so revert that change. 
So I could have skipped the apt-get remove and used upgrade in the venv

Except the newest bottle didnt help; and now the stack trace is on server.py stderr instead of the Web UI.
Upgrading mako did the trick. Didnt need to add views/ to lookup argument after all.

URLS:
localhost:8080/splash_page

localhost:8080/system_info

localhost:8080/settings

localhost:8080/  aka index

By default images get saved into $HOME/screenly_assets

Not showing.  Turned off splash. 

Problems with socat: socat[3207] E connect(3, AF=1 "/tmp/uzbl_socket_3179", 23): No such file or directory
--> the socket to control uzbl is named differently so I added a fallback for that

By lucky fluke, this is firing up on my secondary monitor, awesome!

Note - to enable stack traces in the web server, 
from bottle import debug
then debug(True) just before run(....)

Raspberry Pi implementation of a large screen media display
===========================================================

1. Photo Memorabilia / Thank Sponsors / Advertising
------------------------------------------------

Prototyped already using screenly.
LCD TV will display seqntially or randomly a series of photos, advertising pages, and thank the sponsor messages.

2. Kitchen Menu
---------------

Our awesome cook wants to show the menu on Thursday/Saturday teas :-)

We could have this as a mode, where the menu shows repeatedly, in between 1-N sets of photos, etc.

This leads me to think we could actually have multiple sets of #1 above saved, to choose between, as well.

3. Immediate Upload Mode
------------------------

Allow committee to uload photos during already play with rules on when to display

4. Announcement Mode
--------------------

We could allow committee to type in a message to be displayed.
Have rules on when to show on and how long, etc.
Perhaps this could be on the (a) ticker instead.
e.g. game day half time scores, other information.

4a. Full Scren Announce mode
4b. Ticker announce mode

5. Kitchen tea announcements
----------------------------
Allow order taker to flash up names, then remove them when they take their dinner
This will complement existing microphone use...

6. Shut Up announcements
------------------------

When the President has the floor, we can have a static 'Please Shut up'
Could have a remote button to press which will flash it :-)

7. Slave Mode
-------------

Dont want to have to upload to systems.
So one is master (the one in the close-offable area)
The one in the bar is a slave.

Design notes 
------------

* Master will have router, slave just a wifi dongle
* Master will run webserver which slave will access for content
* Master will have management webserver for uploading
* Slave will need a way to respond to mode changes
* Consider independent (dual) mode "configurationableness..."


Guidance
--------

The User Interface for uploading after mode selection needs to be DEAD SIMPLE!!!!!

Will work initially on direct cable, using DHCP. So need User Guide on how to config W7
for sharing so laptop can be DHCP server.

Final design will be cable tied to a micro-wireless router so we can just remotely do it.
System will be behind TV making routine physical access dificult

Design Concept
==============

First System
------------

Raspberry Pi running Wheezbian
HDMI cable
240 double adaptor with USB power socket, USB cable, for Pi Power
SD Card
Router (e.g. DIR-505) running OpenWRT, connected to Pi with short CatV ethernet
Router runs DHCP and some security stuff, we dont want randoms realising there is a wifi point they can connect with their Androids...
Heatsink - easier to leave always on, unless we also get a GPO timer

SD Card just has O/S and software (and data), too hard to allow people to keep taking it in/out
Instead we upload to the Pi using management web server
Also have a normal webserver possibly with a browsing URI for testing / checking
Normal webserver also provides URIs for messages (Sponsor thanking, etc)
Status webpage(s) passworded
Entry webpage with funny message...

Implement using screenly.
Augment with a ticker, because screenly just shows photos videos and URLs
Ticker may be a screenly mode, but perhaps easier to use spearately
Need to mod screenly to show a space for the ticker

Second System
-------------

Raspberry Pi running Wheezbian
HDMI cable
240 double adaptor with USB power socket, USB cable, for Pi Power
SD Card
Heatsink - easier to leave always on, unless we also get a GPO timer
Wifi dongle

Screenly and ticker as normal.
Ticker should get info from a HTTP 
So can configure both to access content from other system
Perhaps have a CRON job or something though, because photos are loaded on locally.
Some work needed here.


Experimental Options
--------------------

USB Bluetooth dongle
Bluetooth Keyboard -- allow a _limited_ management mode sans laptop (mode changes)




Future Options
--------------
Spend $100 and put a 12mo prepaid dongle for remote management and status


Initial Shopping List
---------------------

Element14:
2x Raspberry Pi B 512M + case - do we get a spare?
3x micro USB power cable (1 spare)
2x 0.5m ethernet cable (1 spare)
2x 0.5m HDMI cable
1x 5m HDMI cable for STW purposes

2x heatsink
2x double adaptor+2xUSB-power sufficient to power the Pi - like the Jackson ones at KMart
3x 8G SDcard  (1 spare)
2x micro bt dongle
1x bt keyboard $22 @ woolies (do we need a spare?)
1x USB hub (with micro usb power option) + cable for testing and STW
1x 5m ethernet cable for STW purposes

2x compatible Wifi dongle (1 spare)
1x DIR505

Primary Software Packages:

Wheezbian - look at mirroring a chunk so dont need to rely on internet
OpenWRT custom image for DIR-505
Screenly
uzbl   <-- this is a webkit based browser
socat  <-- used for comms with uzbl
feh    <-- image viewer

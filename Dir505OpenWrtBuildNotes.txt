Build Instructions for tweaked OpenWRT on DIR-505
=================================================

Out of the box the DIR-505 firmware is a bit annoying, no obvious way to bridge the ethernet port and wifi onto the same subnet, it is geared up to be an Internet router.

So use OpenWrt to resolve this.

DIR-505 is apparently supported in Attitude Adjustment: http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/d-link/dir-505 and definitely in the current trunk.

We need to build from git trunk sources.  I also like to make my OpenWRT image highly specific as possible, but to start with make it close to the standard OpenWRT to sanity check.

    mkdir -p $HOME/develop/club/openwrt/DOWNLOAD
    git clone git://git.openwrt.org/openwrt.git 
    cd openwrt

    scripts/env new club
    cat > .config <<EOF
    CONFIG_TARGET_ar71xx=y
    CONFIG_TARGET_ar71xx_generic=y
    CONFIG_TARGET_ar71xx_generic_DIR505A1=y
    CONFIG_DEVEL=y
    CONFIG_DOWNLOAD_FOLDER="$HOME/develop/club/DOWNLOAD.openwrt"
    CONFIG_BUILD_LOG=y
    CONFIG_NEED_TOOLCHAIN=y
    EOF
    scripts/env save

    # Note, without CONFIG_DEVEL the above changes dont stick properly

    cp feeds.conf.default feeds.conf

    scripts/feeds update -a
    scripts/env revert

    scripts/feeds install \
    coreutils-dd coreutils-od gzip tar sed patch \
    less vim screen procps-ps wget wavemon \
    bridge ethtool mii-tool socat rsync tcpdump lsof nmap mtd-utils ntpdate 
    scripts/feeds list


    make defconfig
    make prereq
    make -j4

This produces `bin/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-dir-505-a1-squashfs-factory.bin`

Flash procedure
---------------

Safest way to flash:

1. Power off
2. Hold in reset pin (need a jewellers screwdriver or pin, etc)
3. Power on.  Wait for red LED to flash
4. Set PC ethernet to 192.168.0.2
5. Connect ethernet to DIR-505
6. Browse to 192.168.0.1.  Note - in the past with D-Link recovery I had trouble with Firefox and Chrome, so for now I do this from Windows with IE.
7. Upload the factory image.
8. When completed, wait 30 seconds then power cycle. Note, NOT successful until LED turns green. Ensure power stays off until LED turns off
9. On reboot, LED is red for about 30 seconds, then green, if DLink. OpenWRT, will flash green.
10. 192.168.1.1 is default eth address, can telnet in now.

Note, eth0 is Wifi, eth1 is Ethernet.

Additional Packages and Customisation
-------------------------------------

Rebuild with more packages; to expedite setup, I added web interface, and WPA, as modules for now.

    scripts/feeds install luci-mod-admin-mini luci
    make menuconfig  
    # <-- select luci, wpa-supplicant wireless-tools wpa-cli usbutils - as built in not module, to facilitiate new builds.
    # <-- select tcpdump as module (diagnostic tools)
    # <-- select Video support, phillips USB webcam, gscpa-core and all the gspca usb webcams as modules
    # <-- remove ppp
    # <-- global build, disable ipv6, remove net: 6relay, odhcp6c, netfilter-ip6 etc until no ip6 related are selected
    make -j4

Upgrade - full reflash:
-----------------------

The following procedure bricked the router, so I reflashed it using the reset procedure above. Unsure why.


Copy sysupgrade image file to web server.
A good solution is to symlink the openwrt parent directory into ~/public_html 
Then telnet into device.

Here, 192.168.1.2 is the development machine connected to the router.

sysupgrade -n http://192.168.1.2/~$USER/club/openwrt/bin/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-dir-505-a1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin

Note, sysupgrade direct pulls from web to flash.
If you have issues with power supply, may be safer to copy to /tmp and flash from there.
